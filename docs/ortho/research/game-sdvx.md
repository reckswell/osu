# Sound Voltex: track camera and highway geometry

Last checked: 2026-11-03

## Summary

Sound Voltex (SDVX) draws one flat highway, seen in perspective by a camera that does not move unless the chart moves
it. The highway has 4 BT lanes in its central two thirds and a laser margin on each side.

**We could not measure an arcade frame.** None of the hosts we found serving SDVX gameplay images could be read from
this environment. The geometry below therefore comes from the two open-source clones, whose code we projected
ourselves (`game-usc.md`):

- **Unnamed SDVX Clone (USC)**, in portrait: a camera its developers tuned to match the arcade. We use it as the
  arcade proxy.
- **USC in landscape**: the same rig, re-aimed for PC windows.
- **K-Shoot MANIA (KSM)**: the classic landscape clone.

All three agree on the look:

| Feature | Value |
|---|---|
| Far end of the track | very narrow, **0.09-0.12 of the near width** (Chunithm 0.24) |
| Track plane vs image plane | about **70-75°** |
| Visible track | 10-13 track widths long |
| Vanishing point | on screen, just above a visible far edge, 26-35% below the top |

**For a landscape window, USC landscape gives:**

| Feature | Value |
|---|---|
| Judgement ("critical") line | **0.941H** |
| Far edge | **0.284H** |
| Whole highway at the line | **0.435W** (BT area 0.290W) |
| Far/near width | **0.106** |

Notes move linearly along the track, so they crawl far away and rush in at the end. A note spends **half its visible
time in the top 10% of the track's screen height**.

The proposed Voltex preset is in *What this means for us* (P1).

## Scope, evidence and versions

**Evidence used, strongest first.**

1. **Open-source code, MIT, projected by us.** USC and KSM v1/v2, read at pinned commits. The method and every
   line reference are in `game-usc.md`. The arcade proxy is USC's portrait camera, which was tuned against the arcade
   in 2019-2020:
   - b1b699d: "better in portrait than in landscape";
   - 6e2af64: "Update critical line position";
   - e33b837: "Adjust camera values to better match SDVX when in portrait mode";
   - d344d56: "Fix default highway pitch in portrait mode";
   - PR #267 claims "almost all aspects of SDVX's camera have been fully replicated" [U2].

   How the static geometry was compared with the arcade is not documented (**unverified**).
2. **Guides and wikis** for options, controls and the cabinet:
   - voltexes.com EG guides [S2][S3];
   - RemyWiki [S1][S7];
   - Wikipedia [S4] and pixiv dictionary [S5];
   - KONAMI's own description [S8].
3. **A Konasute screen-reading tool**, sdvx_helper (Apache-2.0) [S6], for screen orientation and size.
4. **The VOX chart format**, as documented by vox2ksh (MIT) [S9]: only for what the chart-driven camera parameters
   mean. Its evidence folder describes itself as LLM-generated, so it is treated as low confidence.

**Could not be read:**

- konami.com product pages (client error);
- 4gamer.net images (blocked);
- silentblue.remywiki.com (robots);
- giantbomb;
- Wikimedia Commons;
- GitHub issue search;
- GitHub user-attachment images.

No arcade or Konasute gameplay frame was available to measure. **Every arcade geometry number in this note is a
code-derived proxy.**

**Versions.**

- USC's portrait tuning dates from the VIVID WAVE era (2019-2020). `Camera.hpp:3-7` cites "VVD" behaviour.
- The options sources describe EXCEED GEAR (VI, Valkyrie and standard cabinets).
- The current version is ∇ (Nabla) [S10]. vox2ksh reads "NABLA build" DLLs [S9].
- No source found documents a change of highway geometry between versions (**unverified**).

## Camera and track

### The arcade screen

- **Portrait.** Konasute (the PC version) renders the game as a portrait 1080×1920 image. sdvx_helper normalises
  captures to "the 1080×1920 portrait image after rotation". It handles the image upright, or rotated 90° or 270° in
  a 1920×1080 landscape window (`screen_layout.py:1-4`, `define.py:3`, `classes.py:65-71`,
  `direct_window_capture.py:18-19` [S6]).
  - The Konasute EG version renders at 1080p and 120 fps, and asks for a display of at least 1280×720 [S7].
  - The EG arcade monitor runs at 120 Hz, with a touchscreen below it on the Valkyrie model [S1].
  - **SDVX has no landscape layout** (inference: the PC version itself only rotates the portrait image).
- **Direction of travel.** Objects "come from the back toward the front" and are hit "when they overlap the judgement
  line" [S8]. Wikipedia: "the Critical Line at the bottom of the screen" [S4].
- **Screen layout around the track** (USC's portrait skin, copying the arcade):
  - a banner across the top;
  - the track in the middle;
  - an "IO console" panel below the critical line (`gameplay.lua:380-383,632-633` [U1]).
  - On Konasute ∇/EG, the BPM / LANE-SPEED panel sits at the left, at y 420-508 of 1920 (sdvx_helper's play-screen
    detector crop, `screen_layout.py:187` [S6]). That is above the far part of the track.

### Geometry

Code-derived by projecting each clone's default camera, with no chart effects (method in `game-usc.md`). y is from the
top in screen heights H; widths are fractions of screen width W; "track" is the whole highway including the laser
margins.

| Quantity | Arcade proxy: USC portrait, 9:16 | USC landscape, 16:9 | KSM v2/v1, 16:9 | Chunithm, for comparison |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Judgement line y | 0.707H (console below) | **0.941H** | 0.885H | 0.926H |
| Far edge y | 0.354H | **0.284H** | 0.262H | 0.163H |
| Track width at the line | 0.810 of portrait width | **0.435W** | 0.400W | 0.611W |
| BT-lane area at the line | 0.540 of portrait width | **0.290W** | 0.263W | — |
| Far/near width ratio | 0.089 | **0.106** | 0.121 | 0.241 |
| Vanishing point y | 0.320H | 0.206H | 0.177H | −0.079H |
| Edge lean from vertical | 30.5° | 27.8° | 26.7° | 28.4° |
| Vertical FOV / track-to-image-plane angle | 90° / 70.2° | 60° / 71.25° | 45° / 75° | 27.5° / 74.2° |
| Eye height and distance behind the line (track widths) | 0.80, 0.88 | 0.90, 0.88 | 0.96, 1.50 | 0.89, 1.70 |
| Visible track length (track widths) | 12 | 10 | 12.7 | 6.17 |

**How much of the track is visible.**

- All of it, from the line to a far edge that is a visible, narrow edge against the background. Nothing hides it.
  The track texture is opaque to the end in USC; whether the arcade's lane fades at its far end is **unverified**.
- Below the line, the track continues off the bottom of the screen in landscape. In the arcade, the console sits
  there.
- The visible length is fixed. Speed changes how fast notes move along it, not where they appear.

**The vanishing point is on screen.** In all three SDVX cameras the lane edges, extended, meet a little above the far
edge: 0.21H in USC landscape, 0.32H in portrait. The far edge cannot reach the top of the screen without changing the
camera.

**Depth profile** (USC landscape; d = fraction of the visible time still to go; speed relative to the speed at the
line):

| d | y | Track width | On-screen speed |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (line) | 0.941H | 0.435W | 1.00 |
| 0.10 | 0.604H | 0.236W | 0.29 |
| 0.177 | 0.500H | 0.174W | 0.16 |
| 0.25 | 0.442H | 0.140W | 0.10 |
| 0.50 | 0.347H | 0.083W | 0.037 |
| 1.00 (far edge) | 0.284H | 0.046W | 0.011 (1/90) |

- A note is in the lower half of the screen only for the **last 17.8%** of its visible time. In Chunithm it is the
  last 23%.
- Near the line it moves **6.2 H per visible time**, against 3.2 in Chunithm and 1.0 for a flat full-height mania
  stage.
- The arcade proxy is even more compressed (r 0.089): the first half of the visible time is spent between 0.35H and
  0.38H.

### Default camera and chart-driven motion

- **The rest pose is the camera above.** With no chart effects active, the camera is static: zoom, pitch and offset
  are 0, there is no roll and no spin [U1].
- **Everything else is chart-driven** (details in `game-usc.md`):
  - Lane roll toward active lasers, about 10° (×1.75, ×2.5 in the "bigger" and "biggest" modes).
  - Manual tilt.
  - Spins and swings on slams.
  - Slam shake.
  - Lane rotation about the critical line (VOX `CAM_RotX`, KSH `zoom_top`).
  - Zoom toward the line (`CAM_Radi`, `zoom_bottom`).
  - Lane split (`Morphing2`) and lane hiding (`LaneY`) [S9].
- **All of it is out of scope**: SPEC 2 forbids camera motion from beatmap data, and the roll also rotates the
  judgement line, which SPEC 2 never allows.
- **Unit mappings** (low confidence, from vox2ksh's regression) [S9]:
  - `CAM_RotX` 1.0 ≈ `zoom_top` 140, about 21° of lane rotation in KSM (15° per 100).
  - `CAM_Radi` 1.0 ≈ `zoom_bottom` −125.
  - A tilt value of 1 = 10°.

## Note approach and speed

- **Linear in track space.** Both clones place a note at (time to hit) / (visible range) along a straight track, so
  under perspective notes crawl far away and accelerate near the line. Arcade: unverified, but consistent with
  KONAMI's "from the back toward the front" [S8].
- **Clone speed formulas** (`game-usc.md`):
  - USC: visible time T = 480000 / (BPM × hi-speed) ms, "8 beats (2 measures) in view at 1x".
  - KSM: about 448,900 / (BPM × hi-speed) ms.
- **The arcade.**
  - EG renamed the setting "Lane Speed" (レーンスピード), shown to two decimals [S1][S3].
  - RemyWiki: "Unlike in previous installments, the Hi-SPEED value does not pertain to the BPM" [S1].
  - voltexes suggests 3.00-4.00 for beginners and 7.00-8.20 for advanced players [S2].
  - **How lane speed maps to visible time is unverified.** If lane speed is mod-speed / 100, as the advanced range
    suggests (our inference), USC's constant gives 686-585 ms for 7.00-8.20, and KSM's 641-547 ms. That is mania
    speed 16.7-19.6 or 17.9-21.0, by 11485 / T.
- **BPM changes.** Lane speed is BPM-independent in its display [S1], and SDVX charts change scroll speed with BPM and
  with `ManualSpeed` controls [S9]. Whether EG keeps visible time constant at the main BPM is **unverified**. Mania's
  own SV behaviour stays regardless (SPEC 3).

## Judgement line and receptors

- **The critical line** spans the whole highway, laser margins included. USC draws it at the projected line, with
  laser cursors riding on it (`Game.cpp:826-844` [U1]).
- **Position:** 5.9% above the bottom in USC landscape, 11.4% in KSM. In the arcade proxy it is 29% above the bottom,
  with the console panel filling the space below.
- **No on-screen receptors.** The receptors are the physical buttons: 4 BT in a row, 2 FX below them, and 2 knobs
  [S3][S5].

## Lane covers / walls

- **Arcade.** The EG play-options guide lists no lane cover, HIDDEN or SUDDEN option [S2]. This is an unverified
  negative: we could not read the official option list.
- **Charts can hide the lane** with `LaneY` and shade it with `LANECLEARCOL` [S9]. That is chart-driven, so out of
  scope.
- **USC adds its own HIDDEN/SUDDEN.** Off by default; when on, it fades notes over a fraction of the track length and
  keeps speed (`game-usc.md`).
- **Nothing here argues for a wall in the Voltex preset.** Keep wall 0.

## Notes and holds (shapes, rendering)

- **Two chip kinds.** BT chips are white bars one BT lane wide. FX chips are orange bars two BT lanes wide, drawn on
  the FX lanes. Long BT and long FX are held bars [S3][S5].
- **USC's chip** (`game-usc.md`):
  - 0.125 track units deep, 1.25% of the visible track, about **76 px at 1080p at the line**.
  - Its leading edge is on the line at the hit time.
  - It is stretched up to 2× toward the far edge, a USC choice.
- **The arcade's chip depth is unverified.**
- **Lasers and slams** are curves and horizontal bars that run across the full width. Mania has nothing like them.

## Key count and lane layout

**SDVX, every chart, one layout** [S3][S4][S5], `Track.cpp:10-14,428-470` [U1]:

| Lane | Count | Width | Where | Hit with |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BT | 4 | 1/6 of the highway each | the central 4/6 | 4 white buttons in a row |
| FX | 2 | 2 BT lanes each | FX-L over BT A+B, FX-R over BT C+D | 2 buttons below the BTs |
| Laser | 2 (blue left, red right) | — | anywhere across the full width; the outer 1/6 on each side exists for them | 2 knobs |

Wikipedia calls the whole thing "the course lane, which consists of 6 columns with rails" [S4]. Since III, lasers can
also leave the lane ("レーンからはみ出た") [S5].

- KSM uses the same layout: BT area 0.656 of the highway width (`game-usc.md`).

**How ours differs:**

- osu!mania has N equal lanes, 1K-10K (and dual stages), all hit with keys. It has no FX lanes, no lasers and no
  laser-only margins.
- SDVX's camera never changes with the chart's layout, because there is only one layout.
- 4K mania maps naturally onto the 4 BT lanes. That is what 4K → KSH converters do (inference; not checked).
- 5K-10K have no SDVX counterpart.
- Our track is the lanes and nothing else. The laser margins (1/6 of the SDVX highway on each side) would be pure
  decoration.

## Feedback (judgement display, hit effects, lane lighting)

Not researched beyond what the clone code shows:

- USC shows button hit effects for 4/60 s (BT) and 3/60 s (FX), plus delayed fades (`Track.hpp:6-9` [U1]).
- Key beams rise from the line when a button is pressed (SPEC 5 already asks for this).
- Judgement text and early/late appear near the line.
- EG adds ±ms and EARLY/LATE display options and a judgement-display height option [S2].

A dedicated feedback note would be needed before copying any of this.

## What this means for us

All of this is visual: settings, not mods (invariants 1 and 3). Values are proposals for the main session to record in
`DECISIONS.md`.

### P1. Voltex preset values (SPEC 2)

Copy **USC's landscape camera**:

- It is SDVX's rig, which USC tuned in portrait against the arcade, re-aimed for a landscape window.
- It is MIT and fully derivable.
- KSM agrees with it within about 15% on every parameter except the judgement line.
- The arcade proxy itself (portrait) cannot be used directly. Its line sits 29% up, over a console, and its track
  would be only 0.26W wide if the portrait frame were fitted to a landscape window's height.

| Setting | Proposed | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `CameraMode` | **Perspective** | Every SDVX reference draws one perspective plane (all three projected cameras). |
| `FarWidthRatio` | **0.106** | USC landscape 0.106; arcade proxy 0.089; KSM 0.121. All are well below Chunithm's 0.24, which matches SPEC's "narrow far end". |
| `JudgementLineHeight` | **0.059** | USC landscape line at 0.941H; USC's own HUD assumes 0.95 (`gameplay.lua:229`). KSM is 0.114. The arcade's 0.29 only exists because of the console. |
| `FarEdgeHeight` | **0** now; **0.284** if Alpha accepts the faithful edge (Q-V1) | USC landscape far edge 0.284H (KSM 0.262, arcade proxy 0.354). 0 keeps SPEC 2 ("notes enter at the top edge") and matches the Chunithm preset under Q7's default (a). |
| `TrackWidth` | **0.435** for every key count | The whole SDVX highway at the line in USC landscape, 16:9. It also equals SPEC 5's 45% for 4K. The faithful lane-for-lane alternative is in P2. |
| `Wall` | **0** | No arcade lane cover found [S2]. |
| `LaneGuides` | **on** | SDVX draws thin dividers between BT lanes (USC's track texture). |

**What the far-edge choice costs.** Same J, r and width in all three variants; 1920×1080; mania speed 29 = 396 ms, and
640 ms ≈ an SDVX-typical speed by USC's constant:

| Variant | Far edge | Vanishing point | Edge lean | Speed at the line | Time in the lower half | 2.55% note at the line |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F, faithful (USC) | 0.284H | 0.206H, on screen | 27.8° | 6.2 H/VT: 15.7 H/s at 396 ms, 9.7 at 640 | last 17.8%: 70 ms at 396, 114 at 640 | 140 px |
| M, VP at the top edge | 0.100H | 0 | 22.3° | 7.9 H/VT: 20.0 H/s, 12.4 | last 10.5%: 41 ms, 67 | 180 px |
| **S, stretched (proposed now)** | 0 | −0.112H | 20.2° | 8.9 H/VT: 22.4 H/s, 13.9 | last 8.5%: 34 ms, 55 | 201 px |
| Chunithm preset now (stretched) | 0 | −0.292H | 24.0° | 3.9 H/VT: 9.7 H/s, 6.0 | last 17.0%: 67 ms, 109 | 98 px |
| Voltex placeholder now (0.3 / 15% / 0 / 0.5) | 0 | −0.364H | 20.1° | 2.8 H/VT | last 17.4% | 74 px |

H/VT means screen heights per visible time.

- At the far edge, a 4K lane is 22 px wide and a 7K lane 13 px, in every variant. At the line they are 209 px and
  119 px.
- Stretching to the top makes the near-line rush **43% faster** than faithful, and flattens the lean from 28° to 20°.
- The faithful edge keeps SDVX's look, with a visible narrow far end in the upper third. It also leaves a band above
  it for the osu! HUD, as Chunithm's 16% does.
- The current placeholder is far from SDVX: three times the far width, and a gentle profile.

### P2. Lanes (SPEC 5)

- **Default:** mania's N equal lanes fill the whole SDVX highway (0.435W).
  - A 4K lane is then 1.5 SDVX BT lanes wide (0.109W, 209 px at 1080p).
  - A 7K lane is 0.062W (119 px).
  - This is one value for every key count, as in the Chunithm preset, and keeps 7K readable.
- **Optional, cosmetic, later: "SDVX rails".**
  - Draw a blue left and a red right side band, each 1/6 of the highway, with the lanes in the central 2/3.
  - For 4K that is exactly SDVX's BT lanes: lanes 0.290W, outer edge 0.435W.
  - 0.290W is also Alpha's flat 4K stage width (0.28W, `baseline-alpha.md`).
  - Off by default. The bands carry nothing; never fake FX lanes or lasers.
- **7K and above.** Under r ≈ 0.1 the outer lanes lean 28° (faithful) and far lanes are 13 px wide. SPEC 5's
  per-key-count relief, for example raising r toward 0.15 at 7K+, should be allowed in this preset, unlike Chunithm's
  fixed field. The value comes from playtests.

### P3. Speed and readability (SPEC 3)

- **Keep SPEC 3 unchanged.** It matches both clones: visible time is the setting, and notes move linearly in track
  space.
- **Playtest at two speeds.** SDVX's compression is about twice Chunithm's near the line.
  - At Alpha's 396 ms, a note is in the lower half for only 34-70 ms, depending on the far-edge variant (P1 table).
  - Compare sheets for the Voltex preset need mania speed 29 (396 ms) **and** about 18 (640 ms, SDVX-typical by
    USC's constant; arcade mapping unverified).
- **Optional hint.** Show "≈ SDVX mod-speed 480000 / T" next to the speed. It is only a hint, since the arcade's own
  constant is unverified.

### P4. Note thickness (SPEC 6)

- **`HighwayNoteLayer.NOTE_THICKNESS` (0.0255, Chunithm's TAP) is too thick for this camera.** The thickness is a
  fraction of the visible track, and SDVX's near track is far more magnified. The same fraction gives 140 px
  (faithful) to 201 px (stretched) at the line, against 81-98 px in Chunithm.
- **Make thickness per preset.** For Voltex use **0.0125**, USC's chip (0.125 of a 10-unit track). That gives 76 px
  (faithful) or 108 px (stretched) at 1080p, Chunithm-sized on screen.
- Alternatively, define thickness as an on-screen size at the line (*tune*).
- Leading edge on the line at the hit time, as now; USC does the same.

### P5. No camera motion (SPEC 2)

- Use only SDVX's rest pose.
- Laser roll, zoom and spin are chart-driven, and the roll also tilts the judgement line, so none of them may be
  implemented.
- A future "kiai sway" (SPEC 2, optional) must not borrow SDVX's roll, since that moves the line.

### Where SPEC.md's assumptions about SDVX hold or fail

1. **"Voltex: strong tilt, narrow far end" (SPEC 2): holds.** The far end is 0.09-0.12 of the near width, and the
   track plane sits 70-75° from the image plane.
2. **Notes enter at the top edge, with the VP at or above the top (SPEC 2): fails for SDVX.** Notes enter at a narrow
   far edge 26-35% below the top, and the VP is on screen. The same conflict as Chunithm's Q7, but stretching costs
   more here (P1).
3. **Typical far/near width 0.3-0.6 (SPEC 2): SDVX is 0.09-0.12.** The range should be 0.08-0.6. The code's
   `MIN_FAR_WIDTH_RATIO` of 0.05 already allows it.
4. **Judgement line at 12% (SPEC 2):** 5.9% in USC landscape and 11.4% in KSM. The arcade's 29% only works because
   of its console.
5. **"Notes move linearly in track space … it is what SDVX does" (SPEC 3): holds** in both clones' code; arcade
   unverified.
6. **4K track about 45% of screen width (SPEC 5): holds** for the whole SDVX highway (0.435W). The BT area alone is
   0.29W.

### Questions for Alpha (for `QUESTIONS.md`)

- **Q-V1.** In the Voltex preset, may notes enter at SDVX's narrow far edge, 28% below the top (faithful, with the
  vanishing point visible just above it)? Or must they enter at the top edge, which makes notes rush 43% faster near
  the line? Same question as Q7 for Chunithm.
  - **Default until answered:** whatever Q7 resolves to; currently (a), far edge at the top.
  - **Recommendation:** faithful (0.284).

## Unverified / open questions

- **Arcade geometry.** No frame was measured. Every arcade number is USC's portrait camera, whose comparison with the
  arcade is undocumented. Measuring one EG or ∇ frame would settle P1. Needed: the line y, the far edge y, the
  near-edge and far-edge widths, from a 1080×1920 capture.
- **Far end.** Whether the arcade lane fades out at its far end, or ends at a hard edge.
- **Lane speed.** How it maps to visible time in EG and ∇, and whether the main BPM is normalised.
- **Lane covers.** Whether the arcade has any HIDDEN/SUDDEN-style option. None is listed in the EG guide.
- **Chip depth** in the arcade.
- **Version changes.** Whether the static geometry changed between versions (II → ∇).
- **The 4K → KSH converter** lane mapping (inference only).
- **The vox2ksh camera constants** (140, −125), which are regression results in a self-described LLM-generated
  document.
